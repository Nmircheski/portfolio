# 🚀 My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This repository showcases my front-end development skills using **Angular**, **Nx**, **TypeScript**, and other modern web technologies. The goal of this project is to demonstrate code quality, architecture decisions, and UI capabilities through a modular and scalable application setup.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Angular** – Framework for building dynamic front-end applications
- **Nx** – Monorepo tool for scalable development and code sharing
- **TypeScript** – Strongly-typed language for robust and maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS** _(optional)_ – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **RxJS** – Reactive programming for managing asynchronous data
- **Jest / Karma** – Testing setup for unit and integration tests

---

## 📁 Project Structure

This project is built using an **Nx monorepo** layout and follows best practices for separation of concerns and code reuse.
