    I'm a full stack developer (React.js & Node.js) with a focus on creating
    (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences that are fast,
    accessible, visually appealing, and responsive. Even though I have been
    creating web applications for over 7 years, I still love it as if it was
    something new.
